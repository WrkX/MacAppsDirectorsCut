# Added

[Dia](https://www.diabrowser.com/) (*Alpha*): New Browser from the creators of Arc. Still rough around the edges, also not what I want in a browser but I am a tester so that’s what I do. Still trying it out to see what it's like using what's basically stock Chrome with AI. JK. Not really for me, but if anyone is interested, hit me up in a dm and I can invite some.

[Fork](https://fork.dev/) (**Freemium**): Git GUI, you can test it for free for as long as you want (afaik). Simply awesome, I was struggling with the Xcode GitHub for the longest time, so I picked this up and it's great so far. Xcode always had problems with rebasing/merging for me, Fork worked immediately. Before I already tried [Tower](https://www.git-tower.com/mac) (*Subscrption*), but it's a subscription, and I don't need that in my life. Also, I don't really see any big difference between the two, so I prefer to pay once and get everything instead of paying every month.

[IconChanger](https://github.com/Bengerthelorf/macIconChanger) (**Free, open source**): IconChanger can automatically change the icons of your apps. If you are like me and you don't like the icons of many apps, you can simply use this and automatically them to whatever you want, even after updates. Of course, it doesn't work with the system apps, but that's a macOS problem, and I don't want to disable SIP. You can simply get icons from macOSicons.com or use your own. Before I did this manually, but this is way easier. I also had another app, which name I forgot, but it stopped working for me.

[Hyprnote](https://hyprnote.com/en) (**Free, open source**): This is a very interesting one. It's a note-taking app that can also record your meetings and stuff and use AI combined with your notes you take while doing the meeting to create summaries. You can also use it as a basic note-taking app, but there are so many more features that can help you with your work. So far, I couldn't try it because I was on vacation , but now I am back, so I'm definitely going to try it in real world scenarios. So far, it looks awesome, and I hope it is the way I think it is.

[IINA](https://iina.io/) (**Free, open source**): Known by everyone. While on vacation I was mostly off grid, so I had a few movies and shows downloaded. I tried IINA and [VLC Media Player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-macosx.html) (**Free, open source**). I had IINA first, but randomly, while watching movies, my Macbook froze with the rainbow spin… like every 30 minutes. I was guessing it’s IINA because it never happened before. Well, turns out it also happens while watching with VLC. I had to be connected to the internet for it not happen, so I guess it is caused by Apple Inteligence. Not sure tho. So I went back to IINA because I prefer the interface.

# Noteworthy updates to apps

[Barbee](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/barbee-hide-menu-bar-items/id1548711022?l=en-GB&mt=12) (*Paid*): Price was increased, it is now 2x as much. so 7,99€.

# Apps I have tried that did not stay
[Hashnote](https://hashnoteapp.vercel.app/) (**Free, open Source**): Another note-taking app. I couldn't even try it because it seems to be very buggy. Trying to type something or clicking on anything in the app spiked my CPU to 100% for like 20 seconds, so I immediately trashed it again.

[Pause](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/pause-take-a-break/id1599313358?l=en-GB&mt=12) (**Free**): Alternative to [LookAway](https://lookaway.app/) (*Paid*). Has the barebones feature of “forcing” a break after your specified time has passed. I tested LookAway, but it was constantly breaking my focus and I dont really need this kind of app, but so far Pause seems fine to remind me to take breaks. I do them on my own, so I don’t need a reminder.

# Removed Apps
> [Parsec](https://parsec.app/) (**Free** or *Subscription*): As I already said before, I am a gamer, but I connect via [Moonlight](https://moonlight-stream.org/)(**Free, open source**) to my windows pc. Now, Moonlight has a problem for me. When I press the Q button, and only when I press that one, the Q button gets stuck. I have to cancel it with Esc, but after that, the Q key doesn't work anymore until I restart my Moonlight connection. So in cases where I'm playing games without a controller, I have to use Parsec until I find the cause. Parsec works great, but I haven't found a way to make it work with graphic quality as good as Moonlight's. The two PCs are connected via direct ethernet, so that's not the problem. I hope I can find out what's causing this soon.

I only used Parsec because I had a problem with Moonlight, which was fixed. Supercharge had a problem with their Alt-Q replacement thing, but Sindre fixed it a few hours after I reported it to him, so it's all good now.

> [Whisky](https://getwhisky.app/) (**Free, open source**): Sometimes I want to run a few simple Windows programs and this is faster than connecting to the other pc. Its just a wine GUI, but it works and is simple.

Not yet removed, but soonish. The dev did a great job, but he has no time/fun doing so anymore and I more than understand this. I am very thankful to what he did. Probably gonna try Crossover as soon as a new version (16?) arrives. Until then I will keep using Whiskey for the few cases I need it. 

> [Day One](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/day-one/id1055511498?l=en-GB&mt=12) (**Free** or *Subscription*): A journal App. Since Apple hasnt released their app for MacOS yet, I use Day One and [Everlog](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/everlog-journal/id1519935634?l=en-GB) (**Freemium**). I prefer Day One, but Everlog has a One Time Purchase option. I am still testing both and I am still not sure which one I will use in the future. Both are great.

I don't journal. Despite receiving reminders, I consistently forget to keep up with it. That's why I've uninstalled Day One and Everlog. If the Apple Journal app ever becomes available on macOS, I might consider trying it again.

> [Mountain Duck](https://mountainduck.io/help/) (*Paid*): To mount my other storage directly into Finder. I also tried [Cloudmounter](https://cloudmounter.net/) (*Paid*) which i liked better and is cheaper, but I already paid for Mountain Duck… but hey, I supported a partial open source project so I am totally fine with this.

Koofr is my “main” storage and the app does what I need. If I upload to my Gdrives/Dropbox I use the websites. Again, paid for it, useful app if you need to mount multiple cloud storage providers, but I was using it less than before, so I removed it. I am happy to have supported the developers
