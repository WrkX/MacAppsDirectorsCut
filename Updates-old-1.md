## Added

* [Antinote](https://antinote.io/) (*Paid*): Antinote is the perfect “Scratchpad” notepad for me. I have it constantly running to calc or write down stuff before I clean it up and put into my notes app. Its a temporary note holder. Also, lovely developer, very active. Highly recommend it.
* [FolderPreview](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/folder-preview/id6698876601?l=en-GB&mt=12) (**Free**):  Randomly found this on the App Store. Allows your to use your preview on folders. Super handy, since I tried that all the time, but ofc it doesnt work out of the box.
* [Artykul](https://artykul.org/) (**Freemium**): A beautiful RSS Reader. It is on the pricier side with ~  60€ (if you want the lifetime upgrade), but most RSS readers with its functionality are subscription based without a lifetime option or cost the same, e.g. [Feeder](https://reinventedsoftware.com/feeder/) (*Paid*) for 49€. Currently I am only using the free version, but I will upgrade soon I think!
* [Rocket](https://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/) (**Freemium**): Forgot that in my og list, so not really new, but now I add it here. Basically allows you to easily add emojis. Raycast can do the same, or even the function key on a macbook, but I use Alfred and a normal keyboard, so I dont have that key. Instead, I type :: and a popup appears that lets me quickly access emojis. If you use emojis, try this. The free version should be more than enough for most, but if you wanna support the dev, buy the pro version. Alternatively you could use [Emoogle](https://www.emoogle.org/) (**Free, open source**), but it works a little different, so you will have to check if that works for your “workflow”.
* [RewriteBar](https://rewritebar.com/) (*Paid* or *Subscription*): It's essentially an AI chat tool, mainly designed for grammar checking and improving writing. Just mark your text, press the hotkey that you’ve assigned, and either use one of the predefined actions or create your own ones. Super customizable and also way cheaper than Kerlig, which I will talk about in the “did not stay section”. They offer either the option to let you use their subscription, so you don't have to provide your own API key, or you use your own API keys for a one-time payment. This also does not seem to have an “update time limit” of a year, which is great. So far, very impressive. I found Kerlig earlier, which is why I used it until now, but I immediately went with RewriteBar. Thanks to the user on reddit who recommended it. Also has a PopClip extension that you can install from the app itself.
* [Parsec](https://parsec.app/) (**Free** or *Subscription*): As I already said before, I am a gamer, but I connect via [Moonlight](https://moonlight-stream.org/)(**Free, open source**) to my windows pc. Now, Moonlight has a problem for me. When I press the Q button, and only when I press that one, the Q button gets stuck. I have to cancel it with Esc, but after that, the Q key doesn't work anymore until I restart my Moonlight connection. So in cases where I'm playing games without a controller, I have to use Parsec until I find the cause. Parsec works great, but I haven't found a way to make it work with graphic quality as good as Moonlight's. The two PCs are connected via direct ethernet, so that's not the problem. I hope I can find out what's causing this soon.

## Noteworthy updates to apps

* [Monocle](https://monocle.heyiam.dk/) (*Paid*) The developer added a blur reduction option, which is much easier on the eyes. I’m basically running it non-stop now.
* [Zen](https://zen-browser.app/) (**Free, open source**): I suppose I'll have to mention this every time I update the list. Firefox Zen now has native autofill support, so the extension is no longer needed for some password managers on Mac. Also, the little player that appears in Arc when something is running and PiP has been minimised has been added to Zen. Good job. I still hate Firefox, but since Zen is also my Linux browser, I will use it on Mac too. Just not now, first they need to fix their memory leak stuff (and hopefully add a “Little Arc” like link-preview). I will keep Arc for as long as possible.

## Apps I have tried that did not stay

* [Beaver-Notes](https://beavernotes.com/) (**Free, open source**): Lovely open source notes app… electron-based, but lovely. Might use time to time, even tough it is electron. So why exactly will I do this you ask? Because of [this](https://beavernotes.com/#/Pocket) … and then the features? Massive! And me being able to use my own sync! And it looking sleek… damn, impressive. 
* [Octarine](https://octarine.app/) (**Freemium**): Notes, tasks etc., very similar to Obsidian. Looks great, very fair free tier. No iOS App is a killer for me though. Kudos to the dev, tho.
* [SiYuan](https://b3log.org/siyuan/en/) (**Freemium**): Another note/PKM tool. Electron-based. Also too much stuff for me in there. Most functionality is free in here, too. Otherwise there are 2 different lifetime subscriptions possible. Maybe also worth a try if you are interested in something like Notion/Obsidian/Octarine etc.
* FSNotes ([**Free**](https://github.com/glushchenko/fsnotes) or [*Paid*](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/fsnotes/id1277179284?l=en-GB&mt=12), **open source**): Another notes app. I tried it again, but still, it doesnt 100% fit my needs, so I can also stay with Apple Notes and work on my own App (maybe). 
* [GoodTask](https://goodtaskapp.com/) (*Paid*): Basically an extension to Apple Reminders. You use GoodTasks instead of Reminders, but it creates the reminders in the reminders app. Kinda like ProNotes, just a little “more”. I’m down for apps like this that are bascially extensions to apple apps, but I dont need a lot of new reminders features, Apple just needs to improve on “Smart lists” and “Sections” in Lists and its perfect for my needs. But even without that, Apple Reminders is enough for me. Same reason I dont use [Things3](https://culturedcode.com/things/) (*Paid*). Beautiful app, just more than I need, so I see no reason to spend money.
* [MacDown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com/) (**Free, open source**): Markdown editor, but I prefer Panda. 
* [PearCleaner](https://github.com/alienator88/Pearcleaner) (**Free, open source**): Alternative to Appcleaner. I just prefer the Appcleaner smart delete. Also PearCleaners “Orphan remove” tried to remove stuff from apps that still exist and killed my Karabiner Elements. Thats my fault of course for overseeing that, but I like how Appcleaner does stuff… so I will stay with Appcleaner. 
* [Übersicht](https://tracesof.net/uebersicht/) (**Free, open source**): Lets you create widgets for your desktop. You can create them using html and bash scripts. or download existing ones from the gallery. Great idea, but same “problem” I have with Sleeve. I dont really use my desktop. 
* [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai/) (*Paid*): Lets you automate stuff, change the Touch Bar, etc.. I haven't found a use for it. You can do a lot of things with it, and if I had a Touch Bar MacBook, this app would be very nice, but I don't know what I would do with it that I don’t already have another app for. 
* [Kerlig](https://www.kerlig.com/) (*Paid*): More expensive than RewriteBar, worse in all aspects (imo). Kerlig can also be used like any other AI chat in that using the hotkey opens a chat if no text is selected. It utilizes your own API keys or uses local LLMs from Ollama. The functionality works well, so when I was not dictating to VoiceInk, this saved time (that I can invest in searching for new apps). My wife wanted this app too, but it's very expensive, to be honest, and only comes with one year of updates. After trying RewriteBar, I had no reason to use Kerlig anymore. Luckily, I was only on the trial version.

## Removed Apps

> [Clop](https://lowtechguys.com/clop/) (**Freemium, open source**): To be honest, I only let it monitor my Downloads folder to automatically shrink pictures. I wouldnt miss it if it was gone. I would love to let it automatically do that for my clipboard, but that breaks screenshots I take at work in Citrix Workspace, so I can currently not use this feature. Still great app, maybe I will create a bug for this on github and see if they can somehow create an exclusion list or something.

As I already explained in my o.g. post, I dont really use it, so no reason to keep it. But it is awesome at what it does, so if you need to compress pictures more often than me, this may be the thing for you. [Here is a comparison I did between Clop and TinyPNG](https://www.reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/1jea4ua/comment/miyo9mp/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) if you are interested in that.

> [Bear](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/bear-markdown-notes/id1091189122?l=en-GB&mt=12) (**Free** or *Subscription*): Great notes app. It looks super sleek, this is what apple notes should be. If you dont need your notes synced to another device this app is a great free one. This is the only subscription I use, only because I have not found anything that looks as perfect designwise while being as great as an editor. I tried
>  * FSNotes ([**Free**](https://github.com/glushchenko/fsnotes) or [*Paid*](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/fsnotes/id1277179284?l=en-GB&mt=12), **open source**), which seems fine,
>  * [UpNote](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/upnote-notes-diary-journal/id1398373917?l=en-GB&mt=12) (**Freemium**), which I simply do not recommend because they store your notes without an option to not do that. I don't feel save giving all my information to some guys in Vietnam, without any encryption going on.
>  * [iA Writer](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/ia-writer/id775737590?l=en-GB&mt=12) (*Paid*): Great for writing, but feels a little overkill for notes. Didnt wanna spend 120€ for both apps.
>  * [Typora](https://typora.io/) (*Paid*): Great alternative writing app, way cheaper. No IOS app.
>  * [Obisidian](https://obsidian.md/) (**Free**): I guess everyone knows it? I dont like Electron Apps, so I don’t use this, otherwise this would be it.
>  * [Simplenote](https://simplenote.com/) (**Free**): No customization, also forced Cloud Sync.
>  * [Spaces.](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/spaces/id1509611686?l=en-GB) (**Freemium**): If this would be open source it would be great. But its buggy, doesnt get any updates anymore and way to expensive for what it is. Also basically no customization.
>  * [Notesnook](https://notesnook.com/) (**Freemium, open source**): Electron App. Similar to Notion, has a webapp, is open source AND E2EE?! Wow, if this thing would have a non-Electron Desktop app…
>  * [Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/) (**Free, open source**): Feels kinda weird to use, but I will still try it. Not deleted yet.

I'm trying to get rid of all my subscriptions; they just drain your money, and I lose track of them all. So, I just cancelled the renewal before it happened again. I am back on Apple Notes and will probably try to create my own notes app since nothing satisfies my needs 100%.

> [Ice](https://github.com/jordanbaird/Ice) (**Free, open source**) 


Just mentioned it while talking about [Barbee](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/barbee-hide-menu-bar-items/id1548711022?l=en-GB&mt=12) (Paid), which I find to be the superior choice right now. I was working a little bit on a fork that would have solved my problems with it, but why bother? I prefer to spend my time on other things.
