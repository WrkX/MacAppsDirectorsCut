# Added

* [AlBattery](https://github.com/whuan132/AIBattery-Charge-Limiter) (**Free, open source**): [AlDente](https://apphousekitchen.com/), just as FOSS. Allows you to set limits for charging your MacBook to prevent battery damage. I thought it was unnecessary, and I’m still not sure if it’s really needed, but I suppose it won’t damage my battery, so why not use it. The only thing missing from AlDente seem to be the statistics, but I can live without them. I tested AlDente for a short time, then found this. So if you test this and see something important missing from it, hit me up. Maybe I will switch to AlDente then...

* [VirtualHere](https://www.virtualhere.com/) (**Freemium**): Allows you to forward one device to another pc for free, otherwise you will have to pay. So what I do with it is forward my mouse to my gaming rig, since I find more and more problems that have problems with the emulated mouse from Moonlight. E.g. in Oblivion/Skyrim windows I cannot scroll, in Dune I cannot use quick menus, side mouse buttons dont work in general, etc. VirtualHere makes it so I connect my mouse to the other PC without having to physically connect it. While that is the case I can of course only move the mouse in Moonlight, not outside of it. I set up 2 hotkeys to quickly connect/disconnect, so that is no problem for me.

* [Spokenly](https://spokenly.app/) (**Free**): My replacement for [VoiceInk](https://github.com/Beingpax/VoiceInk). VoiceInk is great, but Spokenly somehow works better for me. It is not open source... however, you can use local models, so I am fine with this. Also, it’s free and on the App Store, which is great. If you’re looking for something open source, give VoiceInk a try. Pay the few $$ for it and help out Pax building the app.

* [HightlightAI](https://highlightai.com/) (**Freemium**): I was looking for an AI assistant for “easy” tasks, like summarizing web pages, etc. etc.. I would love to have the Gemini integration like in Chrome, but I want it de-googled, so I had to search for an app that does this. I tried sooooo many again, and I am really not happy with them—they all have something that bothers me. In the end, I stayed with HighlightAI (for now) because the only downside it has for me is that there is no local LLM support. You can see the others I have tried in my [Updates](Updates.md)... But yes, HighlightAI is context aware, the window doesn’t bug out, and it mostly works. With local LLM support, it would be a 100% match for me.

* [Helium](https://github.com/imputnet/helium-macos) (**Free, open source**): STILL VERY EARLY, BUGS OCCUR. Saw this one in Theo - t3.ggs video and tested it. At first, I thought there weren’t any features that would make me use this over Ungoogled Chromium (which Helium is based on), but it has split view, the password integration works (the system-wide one), more customization options, and bangs. It’s very nice. Also, it doesn’t drain my Macbook like crazy. Without this, I would have gone back to [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or [Ungoogled Chromium](https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium) (**Free, open source**). ****

# Noteworthy updates to apps



</br>

# Apps I have tried that did not stay

</br>

# Removed Apps
> [Dia](https://www.diabrowser.com/) (*Alpha*): New Browser from the creators of Arc. Still rough around the edges, also not what I want in a browser but I am a tester so that’s what I do. Still trying it out to see what it's like using what's basically stock Chrome with AI. JK. Not really for me, but if anyone is interested, hit me up in a dm and I can invite some.

Let’s be honest here; it’s basically just stock Chrome at this point. They replaced Gemini with their AI… and that seems to be it? They’ll again not reach their target audience of 1 bajillion and either abandon this browser again, or will go bankrupt because nobody will fund them again. Maybe they’ll bring six more browsers in the next 10 years. I don’t know, but I’m not going to use this…

> [Arc](https://arc.net/) (**Free**): The dead one. No more development. Still the browser I use the most. If they would have at least added the mac passkey support. Everything else I want from it works. [SigmaOs](https://sigmaos.com/) (**Freemium**) is the “alternative” but I am not sure if its still updated, never ever have I seen such an intransparent product.

While I love Arc, it started draining my battery like a maniac. My Macbook wouldnt go to sleep or wake up randomly at night and every morning the battery was completely drained. Soooo, I cannot continue to use it.

> [IconChanger](https://github.com/Bengerthelorf/macIconChanger) (**Free, open source**): IconChanger can automatically change the icons of your apps. If you are like me and you don't like the icons of many apps, you can simply use this and automatically them to whatever you want, even after updates. Of course, it doesn't work with the system apps, but that's a macOS problem, and I don't want to disable SIP. You can simply get icons from macOSicons.com or use your own. Before I did this manually, but this is way easier. I also had another app, which name I forgot, but it stopped working for me.

I just use the default Icons, the author made some changes and fixed the malware warning, but I don’t need it anymore.

> [Swift Shift](https://www.swiftshift.app/) (**Free**, **open source**): Lets you move and resize windows by holding a modifier key. I missed this so much when switching from Linux Hyprland to Macos. There was a bug which skyrocketed the CPU Usage when a specific option was turned on, but that was fixed. This is the only app that does this which also **smoothly** resizes windows. Alternatively you can use [Easy Move+Resize](https://github.com/dmarcotte/easy-move-resize), but imo Swift Shift is better.

At one point, I just stopped using the "shortcuts", so I’m not going to keep it. If you want these shortcuts, use Swift Shift, it’s great!

> Strongbox ([*Subscription*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RojV4NA60RY) *or* [*Lifetime*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umDr0mPuyQc)): RIP. This was the one, but he joined the dark side. They decided to sell it to a trash company that cannot be trusted. We will see what happens here. I dont like KeePassXC, and this one here worked great. **Seemingly the only other option with a quick search for your passwords I found!** I dont know why all other apps are electron trash that is basically just the homepage. The quick search is essential for me, I don’t know how people live without it.

Trash.

> [VoiceInk](https://github.com/Beingpax/VoiceInk) (*Paid*, **open source**) The best transcription app I have found. The dev is super active, helpful and updates come in regularly. And its a one time purchase of only 19$. I bought it once for me and once for my wife and it just saves sooooo much time. I also tried [MacWhisper](https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/l/macwhisper) (**Freemium**) but I prefer VoiceInk. Only thing I miss is live transcription.

Awesome app, very active developer. I just found [Spokenly](https://spokenly.app/) and for me it works better. Try both and check what works for you.

> [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/) (**free, open source**): Same creators as Mountain Duck, does bascially the same, just without mouting it to finder. I use it for quick sftp stuff, that I dont constantly need.

Did not need it for a long time, so I removed it. 

> [Orion](https://kagi.com/orion/) (**Free**): Webkit Browser with vertical Tabs. Gets updates regularly, I like it and use it whenevery I am on the go. And if I don’t accidentally use Safari anyway.

The browser could be great, but everything breaks. There was a point at which I could no longer connect to any Google site. Extensions are most of the time not working as they should. Whenever something gets fixed, the next best thing breaks. I will check it again in 2-3 years. Only had it as a Safari replacement for the go, but I would rather use Safari than live with countless crashes.
